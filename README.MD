# NodeJS Fundamentals

This project's a API RESTful using Node.js without frameworks or third packages. It's a chapter of [Ignite 2023](https://rocketseat.com.br/ignite), created by @Rocketseat
I've learned about Node.js internal modules like HTTP, Crypto and File System. I've seen about the fundamentals of HTTP like requests, responses, headers, status code, routes, query parameters, etc.
The biggest knowledge has been about Streams to use async operations in the backend.
